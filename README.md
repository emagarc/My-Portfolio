# My-Portfolio

This is the repository of my web portfolio. I have crafted it with React, React Maps, React Spring (to showcase the background stars), emailjs, Styled Components, an array of CSS animations, and React Transition Group. Additionally, I leveraged Three.js to display 3D objects. Here, you can learn more about me, view my latest projects, and access my social media profiles or reach out to me directly.
